# Excel Workbook: LOOKUP, INDEX, MATCH, SUMIFS 


## Objectives

The primary objective of this workbook is to manage large datasets, analyze trends, and generate reports that drive decision-making. I built this workbook to streamline those Analytics, ensuring that I can deliver accurate, timely, and insightful reports without getting bogged down in manual calculations. My hope is that this tool can help others in similar roles achieve the same level of efficiency and precision.


## About This Workbook
This workbook is structured around three main sheets, each serving a specific purpose in the context of business operations:

### Customer Quote Sheet
The Customer Quote sheet is a template I developed for generating detailed and accurate customer quotes for network infrastructure projects. It’s designed to handle multiple variables, ensuring that each quote is tailored to the customer's needs while reflecting accurate pricing and discounts.

Key Features:
Item Code: Every product or service is uniquely identified for easy reference.
Location Code: Specifies where each item will be installed, aiding in logistics planning.
Quantity: Simply input the number of units, and the sheet will handle the calculations.
Retail Price & Discounts: The sheet automatically pulls in retail prices and applies the correct discounts based on customer categories.
Sub Total: The total cost is calculated for you, reducing the risk of errors.
I’ve integrated functions like LOOKUP, INDEX, and MATCH to pull data from other sheets and automatically populate the necessary fields, making the quote creation process quick and efficient.

## International Price List Sheet
The International Price List is a master list that I use to manage our product offerings and pricing. It’s particularly useful for businesses operating across different regions, as it ensures consistency and accuracy in all our sales documents.

Key Features:
Item Codes and Descriptions: Each product is listed with both long and short descriptions to cater to different needs.
Pricing Information: Retail prices are clearly stated, along with any applicable cost prices.
Categorization: Products are categorized, making it easier to filter and analyze the data.
This sheet works seamlessly with the Customer Quote sheet, ensuring that all pricing information is up-to-date and correctly applied.

## Discount Matrix Sheet
I’ve always found it challenging to manage various discount structures, so I created the Discount Matrix sheet to simplify the process. It’s designed to apply the correct discounts based on the customer category, ensuring that we always offer the right price to the right customer.

Key Features:
Discount Categories: Different products or services can be assigned specific discount categories.
Customer Tiers: We’ve defined tiers like Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum, each with its own discount rates.
Automatic Calculations: Using LOOKUP and MATCH, the sheet automatically applies the correct discount based on the customer and product details.
This sheet ensures that our pricing strategy is consistently applied, helping us maintain profitability while offering competitive pricing to our customers.
